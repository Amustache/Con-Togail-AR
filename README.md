# Lorcòn

**Lorcòn** is a location-based [alternate reality game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game) project featuring control points that can be physically moved by players.

## Principle

*See [Pokémon GO](https://pokemongolive.com/fr/)/[Ingress](https://ingress.com/)? See how you can steal building cones when you're drunk? Well, imagine a mix of the two, a kind of Pokémon GO/Ingress but where you can pick up the control points to change their place...*

The idea is simple: cyborg construction cones, called **protocones**, are scattered throughout a given area. Players must find the protocones using their GPS coordinates and capture them so that their team gains **control of an area**. They can then decide to **move the protocone** to control a different area, or **reinforce control of an already occupied area**.

## How it works

To play, you need two main elements: protocols, and a server. Then you have to make sure that players can interact with the protocones and each other using an interface, that can be custom.
